I am Sri Sudheera Chitipolu. My section is 03 and instructor is Nathan.

I am a new member of the Spring Batch 2020 working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science (ACS). This course mostly focuses on latest technologies like Hadoop, Machine Learning, Big data etc with 30 credit hours with including two projects.

I am from India. I graduated in 2017 from Vignan institute of Technology and Science with 75% aggregate. My major was Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). From August 2017 to December 2019 I worked as Tableau Developer for Maces Cloud Hyderabad,India. In free time I do drawings by maintaining all my arts on my Sudheera Arts (Links to an external site.) facebook page and  also I love  dancing.

The main reason to do masters on ACS to earn job as Data Scientist,because Data Scientist is further role of Tableau Developer also it gives opportunity to work on Bigdata and Machine Learning.
